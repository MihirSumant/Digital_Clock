# Digital_Clock

This is a basic project I made to practice and demonstrate my HTML, CSS, & JS fundamentals.

### Features:

- A website that displays a live digital clock showing the current time.
- The time updates every second.
- The user can make the clock switch between 24 hour and A.M.-P.M. formats.  
- No libraries or frameworks used.
